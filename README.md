# Project Overview
MovieMuse is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user-selected titles. By leveraging TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity, the system identifies and recommends movies that are most similar to the user's chosen movie.
# Features
Movie Search: Find movies based on title similarity.
Recommendations: Get a list of movies similar to your favorite ones.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface for quick movie suggestions.
Data Preprocessing:

# Methodology
 ## 1 Data Preprocessing:
Load the movie dataset.
Clean and preprocess the movie descriptions.
TF-IDF Vectorization:

 ## 2 TF-IDF Vectorization:
Convert the movie descriptions into TF-IDF vectors.
Each movie description is transformed into a vector representing the importance of words relative to the entire dataset.
Cosine Similarity Calculation:

 ## 3 Cosine Similarity Calculation: 
 
Compute the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of the selected movie and all other movies.
Identify and rank movies based on their similarity to the selected movie.

 ## 4 Output:
Display the top N similar movies to the user.
